holy relic, the
Triforce, left by
the three goddesses
after the creation of

history repeats itself.
Wherever there is
danger, there is a hero
whose courage drives

all of this, before the

plunge Hyrule into
chaos...
May the hero bring

Had I only been able

They coaxed me into

Please, protect them

happens...
They are hiding in a
palace sitting east
of the mountains. The

must escape from
Agahnim, else the
sorcerer could break
the seal created by
the Solarus Amulet, the
relic worn by Zelda,
necessary to the
gathering of the
Triforce shards.
The mystery of Solarus
is kept safe inside
the relic.
The relic&apos;s owner has
the ability to summon
the Solarus power to
seal an object, a
place or even a world,
as the seven sages once
did when they sealed
away the Golden Land.
Zelda is the heiress of
that power. She used it
to seal the Triforce
shards, using the eight
beings created by the
Solarus.
Thus, as long as she
alone knows the secret
of the relic, she alone
masters the Triforce&apos;s
seal. This is why you
must protect the seal.
